# Project 1: Gun Violence Data Analysis

## Tasks 

- Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
- Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process
- Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**
- Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
- Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
- Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
- Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

- You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation.

- **This will be a formal presentation.**

One in which you explain in detail:

- The questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
- Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
- The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
- The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
- Your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary as well as visualizations of that summary
- Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".
